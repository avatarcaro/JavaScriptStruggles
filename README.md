I wrestled with JavaScript for hours and hours to make this happen. Here you go.

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the P5.js library downloaded, or this won't work.

Built With
p5.js web editor, VS Code

This is made from the Lerp Color and Interactivity 1 examples on p5.js. I'm grateful to the people who created those in the first place.
